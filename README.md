# RESTful_API_Flask
RESTful API with Flask and SQL Alchemy, tested and documented with Postman.

A very simple API project which provides access to data on all the cafes in a particular city to figure out which ones are suitable for remote-work.

This API supports simple operations such as getting all cafes, searching a cafe by location (GET), adding a new cafe (POST), updating data on the existing cafe (PATCH), deleting a cafe (DELETE).
A sqlite DB was used along with SQL Alchemy ORM to store and access cafes' data.
